## TODO List

- [x]: Player must stand in the center of the viewport.
- [x]: Add a temporary inventory and health bar
- [x]: When left mouse button is pressed character shoots bullets.
- [x]: Add a custom combat sprite when character shoots bullets.
- [x]: Enemies appear when the character passes over a tile that triggers their spawining.
- [ ]: Other enemies are already present on the map and start chasing the character if they're at a distance that depends on enemy type.
- [ ]: Add melee weapon implementation.
- [ ]: Add minimap at the top right of the viewport.
- [ ]: Add Main Menu to start and load game.
- [ ]: Add a GUI with inventory, health, mana, quests...

- [ ]: If you point with cursor at an enemy instead of moving you shoot at it.
- [ ]: Window resizing does NOT scale the resolution but enlarges the portion of the visible map.

- [ ]: Add particle effects when a bullet hits a target or a wall.
- [ ]: Add sounds and music.

- [ ]: Enemies pursue the player in paths that depend on the type of enemy: some are faster and more dangerous than others.
- [ ]: Add the ability to enter indoor locations (caves, buildings, etc.)
- [ ]: Each type of ranged weapon has a different sprite for the bullets it produces.
